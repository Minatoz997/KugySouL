# Fixed Word Count Auto-Pilot Feature

This document explains the fix for the auto-pilot feature in the Novel Writer component that was only generating 20 words instead of hundreds of words.

## Problem

The auto-pilot feature in the Novel Writer component was only generating about 20 words per request, as shown in the screenshot where the total word count was only 20 words despite the auto-pilot being active.

## Cause

The issue was in how the frontend processed the response from the OpenRouter API. The API was returning a valid response, but the content extraction logic wasn't properly handling all possible response formats, or the API was returning very short responses.

## Solution

We created a new component called `FixedWordCountAutoPilot` that injects a script to intercept and modify the OpenRouter API requests and responses:

1. The script intercepts all fetch calls to the OpenRouter API
2. When a response is received, it checks if the content is too short (less than 100 words)
3. If the content is too short, it makes a new request with modified parameters:
   - Increases the max_tokens parameter to 1500
   - Adds a system message that explicitly requests at least 500 words
   - Adds instructions to the user message to generate at least 500-800 words

This ensures that the auto-pilot feature generates substantial content (500-800 words) with each request, fixing the issue where it was only generating 20 words.

## Implementation Details

The fix works by:

1. Injecting a script that overrides the global `fetch` function to intercept OpenRouter API calls
2. Checking the word count of the response content
3. If the word count is less than 100 words, making a new request with modified parameters
4. Replacing the original response with the new response that contains more content

This approach doesn't require modifying the original NovelWriter component, making it a non-invasive fix that can be easily applied to any page that uses the NovelWriter component.

## How to Use

1. Visit the `/fixed-word-count-novel-writer` page
2. Set your OpenRouter API key using the API Key Setup button
3. Use the auto-pilot feature as normal
4. The auto-pilot will now generate 500-800 words per request instead of just 20 words

## Technical Details

The script uses the following techniques:

1. **Fetch API Interception**: Overrides the global `fetch` function to intercept API calls
2. **Response Cloning**: Clones the response to read it multiple times
3. **Content Extraction**: Extracts content from various response formats
4. **Word Count Calculation**: Calculates the word count of the extracted content
5. **Request Modification**: Modifies the request parameters to ask for more content
6. **Response Replacement**: Creates a new response with the modified content

## Advantages Over Other Solutions

This solution has several advantages over the other fixes:

1. **Non-invasive**: Doesn't require modifying the original NovelWriter component
2. **Specific to the Problem**: Directly addresses the word count issue
3. **Transparent**: Shows status indicators for when it's modifying requests
4. **User-friendly**: Provides a simple API key setup interface
5. **Robust**: Works with various OpenRouter API response formats
