# Auto-Pilot Feature Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the Auto-Pilot feature in the Novel Writer component.

## Problem

The Auto-Pilot feature was not displaying generated text. The issue was in how the frontend processed the response from the OpenRouter API.

## Solution

1. Enhanced the `autoPilotWrite` function to:
   - Add better error handling
   - Support multiple response formats from OpenRouter API
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when the backend API fails
   - Add direct OpenRouter API integration as a backup

2. Added an API Key setup component to allow users to set their OpenRouter API key for direct API calls

3. Added status indicators to show which API method is being used

4. Created a test page at `/test-openrouter` to verify the OpenRouter API integration

## Files Modified

- `src/components/novel/NovelWriter.tsx` - Updated the Auto-Pilot feature to handle different response formats and added fallback mechanisms
- `src/services/enhancedApi.ts` - Created an enhanced API service with better error handling and response processing
- `src/components/novel/ApiKeySetup.tsx` - Added a component to set the OpenRouter API key
- `src/components/novel/OpenRouterTest.tsx` - Created a test component to verify the OpenRouter API integration
- `src/app/test-openrouter/page.tsx` - Added a test page to use the OpenRouterTest component

## How to Test

1. Visit the `/test-openrouter` page to test the OpenRouter API integration
2. Set your OpenRouter API key using the API Key Setup button in the Auto-Pilot section
3. Try using the Auto-Pilot feature to generate text

## Fallback Mechanism

The Auto-Pilot feature now tries multiple methods to generate text:

1. First, it tries the backend API
2. If that fails, it tries the novel writing endpoint
3. If that fails, it tries direct OpenRouter API using the user's API key
4. If all methods fail, it displays a fallback message

## Status Indicators

The Auto-Pilot feature now shows which API method is being used:

- üîÑ Using backend API...
- üìù Using novel writing endpoint...
- üåê Using direct OpenRouter API...
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Using fallback content...
