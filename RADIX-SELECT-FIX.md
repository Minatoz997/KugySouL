# Radix UI Select Component Fix

This document explains the fix for the `@radix-ui/react-select` dependency issue.

## Problem

The build was failing with the following error:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-select'
https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/module-not-found
Import trace for requested module:
./src/components/ui/index.ts
./src/app/writing-tools/page.tsx
> Build failed because of webpack errors
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 1
```

## Cause

The `@radix-ui/react-select` package was listed in the `package.json` file with version `2.2.5`, but it was not properly installed or there was an issue with the dependency resolution.

## Solution

1. Reinstalled the package with the exact version:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall @radix-ui/react-select
   npm install @radix-ui/react-select@2.2.5 --save-exact
   ```

2. Created a test component and page to verify that the select component works:
   - `/src/components/test/SelectTest.tsx`: A simple component that uses the select component
   - `/src/app/test-select/page.tsx`: A page that renders the test component

## Verification

To verify that the fix works:

1. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit the test page at `/test-select`

3. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Additional Notes

- Using `--save-exact` ensures that the exact version is used, which can help prevent issues with dependency resolution
- The select component is used in various parts of the application, including the writing tools page
- This fix ensures that the application builds successfully on Vercel
